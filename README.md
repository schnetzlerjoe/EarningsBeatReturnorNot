# EarningsBeatReturnorNot
Built for Fenimore Asset Management so they can test various earning beats or misses and see how stocks perform a certain time period after that beat/miss. 
You enter a certain earnings beat/miss and the time period you are interested in and then the script computes the historical return and alpha for a basket of stocks that have experienced the same beat/miss over that time period of interest.
